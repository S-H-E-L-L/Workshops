## Workshop#01: Introduction to Linux

**[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linux")** 🐧 is the most versatile OS , you can see at many places.  It\'s more secure in terms of privacy and the most widely used operating system in world of **Cyber-Security**.

#### Installing Linux

There are mainly three ways you can install linux:
* As a virtual machine (linux inside windows/mac os)
* Dual Boot (alongside windows/mac os)
* WSL (windows subsystem for linux)

WSL is a linux terminal inside windows. It\'s like having a small version of linux running within your windows system.

We suggest that you go for installing it as a VM, since if you make some mistake you won\'t lose anything.

Linux comes in several distros, generally [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop "ubuntu") is recommended for beginners as it is easy to install and use, for hacking purposes however kali is preferred. You can install any of these, or any other distro, it won\'t make much of a difference.

The links for installing are here:

* Kali Linux installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNzpcB7ODxQ&t=5837s (Timestamp :- 1:37:17) (preferred video for installation)

## Workshop#02A: Python Basics

Coding is one of the most important skill in today\'s growing IT world, and [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") is one of the most used and user friendly language.

#### Installing Python

For the next workshop, install Python on your systems. It\'s installed by default on Ubuntu and Kali. You can confirm that by typing,

`python3 --version`

If it gives an error, try

`python --version`

If that's also giving an error, then install python from [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also make sure you have pip installed. You can check this with

`pip3 --version`

or if that gives an error

`pip --version`


## Workshop#02B: Python Keylogger

We built a [Keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging "Keylogger") using the python basics we learned in the previous workshop.

## Workshop#03: Hiding Data in Files

> "Many things are not the same as they appears to us."

*An image might not be just an image.
An audio might not be just an audio.*

We would learn how to hide data in files like image and audios, how to reveal hidden data and corrupted files, use various tools, file headers, and many more ways to hide data.

## Workshop#04: Bash Scripting

> "Automating stuff is much better than re-typing same piece of instructions."

[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29 "Bash") is language of linux, therefore learning bash is necessary for making work easy and reusability.
